# End-of-Life (EOL) Software Monitoring Policy

## Overview

This document outlines our policies and procedures for monitoring end-of-life (EOL) software and dependencies to ensure security and compliance with Plaid's attestation requirements.

## Policy Statement

KillSub maintains a comprehensive EOL monitoring program to:
- Identify software and dependencies approaching end-of-life
- Plan and execute timely upgrades before EOL dates
- Maintain security and compliance standards
- Minimize operational risks

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- **Core Runtime**: Node.js, Next.js framework
- **Dependencies**: All npm packages in package.json
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel platform, Supabase services
- **Third-party Services**: Plaid, Stripe, authentication providers

## EOL Monitoring Procedures

### 1. Automated Monitoring

#### Dependabot Configuration
- **File**: `.github/dependabot.yml`
- **Schedule**: Weekly on Mondays at 9 AM UTC
- **Scope**: All npm dependencies
- **Actions**: Automatic PR creation for security updates

#### GitHub Actions Security Scanning
- **File**: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`
- **Schedule**: Weekly security scans
- **Scope**: Vulnerability detection and EOL package identification
- **Reporting**: Automated alerts for EOL packages

### 2. Manual Monitoring Procedures

#### Monthly EOL Reviews
- **Schedule**: First Monday of each month
- **Responsible**: Development team lead
- **Process**:
  1. Run `npm run deps:check` to identify outdated packages
  2. Review EOL status of major dependencies
  3. Update EOL tracking spreadsheet
  4. Plan upgrade timelines

#### Quarterly EOL Assessment
- **Schedule**: Quarterly business reviews
- **Scope**: All software components
- **Deliverables**:
  - EOL risk assessment report
  - Upgrade roadmap for next quarter
  - Budget allocation for major upgrades

### 3. EOL Classification System

#### Critical EOL (Immediate Action Required)
- **Timeline**: < 30 days to EOL
- **Action**: Immediate upgrade or migration
- **Examples**: Security-critical packages, core runtime

#### High Priority EOL (30-90 days)
- **Timeline**: 30-90 days to EOL
- **Action**: Plan and execute upgrade within 30 days
- **Examples**: Major framework versions, database drivers

#### Medium Priority EOL (90-180 days)
- **Timeline**: 90-180 days to EOL
- **Action**: Include in next quarterly upgrade cycle
- **Examples**: UI libraries, development tools

#### Low Priority EOL (>180 days)
- **Timeline**: >180 days to EOL
- **Action**: Monitor and plan for future upgrade
- **Examples**: Optional dependencies, build tools

## Current EOL Status

### Core Runtime Components

| Component | Current Version | EOL Date | Status | Next Action |
|-----------|----------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Node.js | 18.x LTS | April 2025 | ✅ Current | Monitor for 20.x LTS |
| Next.js | 15.x | TBD | ✅ Current | Regular updates |
| React | 19.x | TBD | ✅ Current | Regular updates |

## Upgrade Procedures

### 1. Pre-Upgrade Assessment
- [ ] Review changelog and breaking changes
- [ ] Test in development environment
- [ ] Identify potential security implications
- [ ] Plan rollback strategy

### 2. Upgrade Execution
- [ ] Create feature branch for upgrade
- [ ] Update package.json and lock files
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment

### 3. Post-Upgrade Validation
- [ ] Verify all functionality works
- [ ] Run security scans
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Update EOL tracking records

## Emergency EOL Procedures

### Security-Critical EOL
When a security-critical package reaches EOL:

1. **Immediate Response** (< 24 hours)
   - Assess security risk
   - Implement temporary mitigations if needed
   - Begin emergency upgrade process

2. **Emergency Upgrade** (< 72 hours)
   - Fast-track upgrade through development
   - Minimal testing for critical security fixes
   - Deploy to production with monitoring

3. **Post-Emergency Review**
   - Conduct post-mortem analysis
   - Update procedures to prevent recurrence
   - Document lessons learned

## Tools and Resources

### Automated Tools
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **npm audit**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **npm-check-updates**: Outdated package detection
- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous security monitoring

### Manual Tools
- **Node.js LTS Schedule**: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/
- **Next.js Release Notes**: https://nextjs.org/blog
- **Package EOL Tracking**: https://endoflife.date/

### Scripts
```bash
# Check for outdated packages
npm run deps:check

# Update all dependencies
npm run deps:update

# Security audit
