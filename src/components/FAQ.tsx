      a: "We analyze transaction patterns and merchant descriptors to flag recurring charges, then surface them for review. We are working on a more accurate way to detect subscriptions.",

      q: "Can you cancel for me?",
      a: "As for now, no. But we will guide you to the correct cancellation page and provide easy steps or templates. We donâ€™t automate cancellations.",

      q: "What does it cost?",
      a: "Nothing! Early access is free and you keep this for life. Cancel anytime.",
